# TraceLink XTT Link Actions Sandbox

The XTT Link Action Sandbox provides a local test environment for developing
XTT Link Actions. The Sandbox mimics the TraceLink XTT Link Action Framework,
which hosts and executes Link Actions inside TraceLink's network. It provides
the ability to run a Link Action locally to connect to an external system, such
as NetSuite or Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Link Actions provide a generic, extensible framework for direct, automated
communication between external systems and TraceLink’s Multienterprise
Information Network Tower (MINT) solution. A Link Action consists of three
parts:
* JavaScript to make API calls to or from an external system.
* Transform to map the data to or from TraceLink’s required canonical formats.
* Configuration parameters to connect to the external system.

The XTT Link Actions Sandbox is used in conjunction with the [XTT Link Actions Test Tool](https://github.com/tracelink/xtt-link-actions-test-tool) to validate
the Link Actions. These two tool make up the XTT Link
Actions Developer Kit.
